        team includes experienced investors and operators like Managing Partner Richard
        Skeet (Head of Research) and partners Stanley Huo (Head of Asia), Jake Greenstein
        (Head of Infrastructure), and Sam Peurifoy (Head of Interactive).\\n\\n- In
        November 2021, within months of launch, Hivemind raised $1.5 billion for its
        first multi-strategy fund to invest across liquid tokens, equity in blockchain
        startups, and digital culture opportunities.\\n\\nAs for major investments
        and acquisitions:\\n\\n- Notable startup investments include crypto companies
        like Helium, GFX, Huddle01, LimeWire, and gaming firms like Napster.\\n\\n-
        In May 2022, Hivemind acquired the iconic music brand Napster to help build
        music entertainment experiences in Web3.\\n\\n- The firm has backed NFT projects
        and platforms like Moonveil (gaming), Tradepor (multichain aggregator), and
        TRLAB (art NFTs).\\n\\nSo in summary, Hivemind was established in 2021 as
        an institutionally-backed crypto investment platform, hit key milestones like
        a $1.5B fund raise soon after, and has rapidly built a portfolio spanning
        equity, tokens, and digital culture investments aligned with its Web3 thesis.\\n\\nSources:\\nhttps://pitchbook.com/profiles/investor/484589-80\\nhttps://tracxn.com/d/venture-capital/hivemind/__fm1o7OgvKH6peR-dl18qc5Ev5P9Pc0ItwPcB576m52U

        of the largest dedicated crypto funds with over $7.6 billion raised across
        four funds. They have invested in major projects like Avalanche, Dapper Labs,
        OpenSea and Solana. Key risks include excessive valuations, regulatory scrutiny,
        and managing a huge portfolio effectively.\\n\\n2. Polychain Capital - An
        early pioneer in crypto funds founded in 2016 with around $1 billion AUM.
        Invests across tokens, equity and liquid strategies. Faces risks around being
        an early mover now with more competition, as well as volatility from large
        token investments.\\n\\n3. Paradigm - A $2.5 billion crypto fund launched
        in 2022, one of the largest ever raised. Led by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam.
        Risks include overpaying for deals and challenges managing such massive capital.\\n\\n4.
        Pantera Capital - The first institutional crypto asset manager founded in
        2013 with $4.6 billion AUM. Potential risks involve operating funds for over
        a decade and key person dependencies.\\n\\n5. Haun Ventures - Newer $1.5 billion
        fund launched in 2022 by former a16z partner Katie Haun. Risks as an emerging
        competitor include unproven track record and heavy competition for deals.\\n\\nSome
        of the major potential risks that these leading crypto venture capital competitors
        face include:\\n\\n- Oversaturation with too many funds chasing a limited
        set of high-quality deals\\n- Regulatory risks around securities laws and
        token investments\\n- Extreme market volatility and cyclicality exposing funds
        to major drawdowns  \\n- Liquidity issues and operational challenges managing

        crypto VC funds must navigate risks around frothy valuations, complex regulations,
        market cycles, operational issues, and continuously raising new funds over

        a few different pricing models and fee structures across their investment
        fund offerings:\\n\\n1. For their venture capital funds investing in equity
        of blockchain/crypto startups, they likely employ a standard venture capital
        management fee model of charging an annual management fee of around 2% of
        committed capital during the investment period, which then drops to around
        2% of invested capital after that initial period. They also traditionally
        take around 20% of any profits from successful exits/company sales as a carried
        interest fee.\\n\\n2. For their liquid crypto trading funds like the recently
        announced open-ended Liquid Opportunity Fund with a $300M target size, they
        charge performance-based fees in addition to a management fee based on assets
        under management (specific percentages not disclosed). This performance fee
        approach aligns incentives by allowing Hivemind to take a cut of any trading
        profits generated.\\n\\n3. For their closed-ended Digital Culture Fund focused
        on investing in NFTs and digital art, while fees are not disclosed, they likely
        charge a premium management fee given the specialized nature of curating and
        managing that portfolio. Premium fees of 2-3% of committed capital would not
        be surprising.\\n\\n4. Overall, Hivemind combines traditional alternative
        investment fund compensation models spanning fixed management fees, performance
        fees, and carried interest - tailoring the specifics to the liquidity profile
        and strategy employed by each particular fund vehicle they offer. Their SEC
        filings indicate using \\\"a fee structure of a percentage of assets under
        management and performance-based fees\\\" (https://www.unbiased.com/advisor-firm/new-york/hivemind-capital-partners-llc-319077).\\n\\nSo
        in summary, Hivemind is flexible with pricing by utilizing a combination of
        annual management fees, performance/incentive fees, and profit-sharing models
        depending on whether the fund focuses on venture equity, liquid crypto trading,
        NFT/digital culture assets or other strategies - all designed to closely align
        incentives with investor returns while fairly compensating their investment
        expertise across these emerging verticals.\\n\\nSources:\\nhttps://www.hivemind.capital/funds

        on the executives and leadership team at Hivemind Capital Partners.\",\"Some
        of the top competitors of Hivemind Capital Partners in blockchain and crypto
        venture investing include:\\n\\n1. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z Crypto) - One
        of the largest dedicated crypto funds with over $7.6 billion raised across
        four funds. They have invested in major projects like Avalanche, Dapper Labs,
        OpenSea and Solana. Key risks include excessive valuations, regulatory scrutiny,
        and managing a huge portfolio effectively.\\n\\n2. Polychain Capital - An
        early pioneer in crypto funds founded in 2016 with around $1 billion AUM.
        Invests across tokens, equity and liquid strategies. Faces risks around being
        an early mover now with more competition, as well as volatility from large
        token investments.\\n\\n3. Paradigm - A $2.5 billion crypto fund launched
        in 2022, one of the largest ever raised. Led by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam.
        Risks include overpaying for deals and challenges managing such massive capital.\\n\\n4.
        Pantera Capital - The first institutional crypto asset manager founded in
        2013 with $4.6 billion AUM. Potential risks involve operating funds for over
        a decade and key person dependencies.\\n\\n5. Haun Ventures - Newer $1.5 billion
        fund launched in 2022 by former a16z partner Katie Haun. Risks as an emerging
        competitor include unproven track record and heavy competition for deals.\\n\\nSome
        of the major potential risks that these leading crypto venture capital competitors
        face include:\\n\\n- Oversaturation with too many funds chasing a limited
        set of high-quality deals\\n- Regulatory risks around securities laws and
        token investments\\n- Extreme market volatility and cyclicality exposing funds
        to major drawdowns  \\n- Liquidity issues and operational challenges managing
        large funds\\n- Excessive valuations and unrealistic expectations during bull
        market periods\\n- Key person risk if founders or key team members depart
        firms\\n\\nWhile they vary in size, vintages and strategies, all of the top
        crypto VC funds must navigate risks around frothy valuations, complex regulations,
        market cycles, operational issues, and continuously raising new funds over
        time. Hivemind will need to carefully construct differentiated strategies
        and leverage its investment team's expertise to succeed against these powerful
        competitors in the increasingly crowded blockchain venture capital market.\",\"Hivemind
        Capital Partners utilizes a few different pricing models and fee structures
        across their investment fund offerings:\\n\\n1. For their venture capital
        funds investing in equity of blockchain/crypto startups, they likely employ
        a standard venture capital management fee model of charging an annual management
        fee of around 2% of committed capital during the investment period, which
        then drops to around 2% of invested capital after that initial period. They
        also traditionally take around 20% of any profits from successful exits/company
        sales as a carried interest fee.\\n\\n2. For their liquid crypto trading funds
        like the recently announced open-ended Liquid Opportunity Fund with a $300M
        target size, they charge performance-based fees in addition to a management
        fee based on assets under management (specific percentages not disclosed).
        This performance fee approach aligns incentives by allowing Hivemind to take
        a cut of any trading profits generated.\\n\\n3. For their closed-ended Digital
        Culture Fund focused on investing in NFTs and digital art, while fees are
        not disclosed, they likely charge a premium management fee given the specialized
        nature of curating and managing that portfolio. Premium fees of 2-3% of committed
        capital would not be surprising.\\n\\n4. Overall, Hivemind combines traditional
        alternative investment fund compensation models spanning fixed management
        fees, performance fees, and carried interest - tailoring the specifics to
        the liquidity profile and strategy employed by each particular fund vehicle
        they offer. Their SEC filings indicate using \\\"a fee structure of a percentage
        of assets under management and performance-based fees\\\" (https://www.unbiased.com/advisor-firm/new-york/hivemind-capital-partners-llc-319077).\\n\\nSo
        in summary, Hivemind is flexible with pricing by utilizing a combination of
        annual management fees, performance/incentive fees, and profit-sharing models
        depending on whether the fund focuses on venture equity, liquid crypto trading,
        NFT/digital culture assets or other strategies - all designed to closely align
        incentives with investor returns while fairly compensating their investment
        expertise across these emerging verticals.\\n\\nSources:\\nhttps://www.hivemind.capital/funds

        within just a couple years of launching, Hivemind has rapidly built out investment
        capabilities through new fund vehicles, assembled a portfolio spanning equity
        and tokens, brought aboard experienced executives, pursued strategic acquisitions

        flagship multi-strategy fund raised $1.5 billion at inception to invest across
