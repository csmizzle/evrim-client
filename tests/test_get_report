        and the Department of Defense.\\n\\nTheir serviceable available market (SAM)
        consists of companies actively pursuing new federal contracts that require
        in-depth market intelligence, competitive analysis, and strategic advisory

        federal contractors as well as mid-tier and smaller firms looking to break

        Strategies was founded in 2012 with the goal of enabling success for clients
        in the federal market. The company was started by Brian Lindholm, who had
        over 20 years of experience working at Fortune 500 companies, smaller firms,
        and consultancies serving both sectors. Lindholm was motivated to start FedSavvy
        Strategies after seeing too many useless plans and expensive generic research
        that claimed to offer business growth strategies but lacked actionable insights
        tailored to each client's needs.\\n\\nThe founding philosophy of FedSavvy
        Strategies, as stated by Lindholm, was to provide expert guidance to help
        clients realistically evaluate where to move forward and how to do it in the
        federal market. Instead of repeating obvious information about the size of
        the federal government and increasing competition, FedSavvy Strategies aimed
        to deliver solutions that save time and provide a greater understanding of
        the money-making opportunities and how to position the client's firm to win
        contracts.\\n\\nSome key events and milestones in FedSavvy Strategies' history
        include:\\n\\n- Founded in 2012 by Brian Lindholm\\n- Focused on providing
        actionable market research, competitive intelligence, capture support and
        other services for the federal contracting market\\n- Helped clients win billions
        of dollars in federal contracts over the past 10 years\\n- Developed proprietary
        databases and analytical methods \\n- Expanded team by carefully hiring personnel
        with skills in market analysis, competitive intelligence, intelligence analysis,
        and business development\\n- No information found on specific mergers, acquisitions
        or major pivots, indicating consistent focus on the original mission\\n\\nThe
        company takes pride in its intense focus on actionable intelligence to help
        clients realize a competitive advantage and position themselves for success
        in the federal market through well-developed strategies and thorough market/competitive

        on the search results, some of the major competitors to FedSavvy Strategies
        in providing competitive intelligence, market research, and strategic positioning
        services for companies pursuing federal government contracts include:\\n\\n1.
        Govini (High Risk)\\nGovini is a leading provider of data, analytics and machine
        learning products focused on analyzing federal procurement and supply chain
        data. With robust data visualization and AI capabilities, Govini is a formidable
        competitor with potential technological advantages over FedSavvy's more traditional
        consulting model.\\nSource: https://www.govini.com/\\n\\n2. Deltek (Medium
        Risk)  \\nDeltek offers a suite of market intelligence and competitive analysis
        tools specifically for government contractors, including GovWin IQ for tracking
        opportunities. As an established player with technology solutions, Deltek
        poses a moderate risk compared to FedSavvy's personalized service approach.\\nSource:
        https://www.deltek.com/en/products/govwin\\n\\n3. ImmixGroup (Low-Medium Risk)\\nImmixGroup
        provides market intelligence services like research and capture strategy support
        for technology firms selling to the public sector. Their deep expertise in
        IT contracting could pose risks for FedSavvy in that segment.\\nSource: https://www.immixgroup.com/services/market-intelligence/\\n\\n4.
        Lincoln Strategies (Low Risk)\\nLincoln Strategies is a boutique consulting
        firm offering market research and strategic planning services for the federal
        government marketplace. Their smaller size and generalist approach likely
        makes them a lower risk competitor to FedSavvy's specialized focus.\\nSource:
        https://lincolnstrategies.com/services/market-research/\\n\\n5. Federal Compass
        (Medium Risk)\\nFederal Compass provides a market intelligence SaaS platform
        with data visualization, analysis tools and strategic solutions tailored for
        government contractors. Their technology-driven model could challenge FedSavvy's
        more traditional consulting services.\\nSource: https://www.federalcompass.com/solution/market-intelligence\\n\\nWhile
        there are a number of firms operating in this space, FedSavvy Strategies'
        targeted focus on competitive intelligence best practices, proprietary databases,
        and founder's deep expertise in the federal contracting field gives it advantages
        over many generalist competitors. However, the emerging use of AI/machine
        learning and robust data platforms at firms like Govini and Deltek pose potential
        high risks that FedSavvy may need to mitigate through continuous innovation
        and leveraging its strengths in human analysis and tailored insights.\",\"Based
        on the search results, FedSavvy Strategies utilizes a variety of pricing models
        and strategies tailored to each service offering:\\n\\nFor online training
        like the \\\"Fundamentals in Competitive Intelligence\\\" course, FedSavvy
        charges a fixed price of $295 per license.\\n\\nFor consulting services like
        Market Intelligence and Account Planning engagements, FedSavvy does not publicly
        disclose pricing. Deliverables feature quantified contract pipelines, competitor
        assessments, barrier analysis and more likely priced using project-based models
        factoring in the scale and complexity.  \\n\\nFedAgency Insight reports providing
        detailed agency buying behavior analysis and proposal insights are offered
        as a standardized product service, likely through annual subscriptions or
        fixed pricing per agency/division.\\n\\nFor rapid consulting sprints, Black
        Hat reviews, Battle Cards and other tailored needs, FedSavvy does not list
        public pricing but potentially uses hourly/daily rate structures based on
        consultant experience levels.\\n\\nThe company seems to use a hybrid approach
        with fixed products, project pricing for custom engagements, subscriptions
        and negotiated bundles. Pricing is opaque but aligned to customer scale and
        requirements in the competitive government contracting space. Free samples
        are limited but FedSavvy provides an intro module of the CI course to preview
        content.\\n\\nOverall, FedSavvy Strategies' pricing structure is designed

        on the information from FedSavvy Strategies' website, some of their major
        products and services in the market intelligence and competitive analysis
        domain include:\\n\\nMarket Intelligence and Account Planning: This is a core
        service offering where FedSavvy Strategies works with clients to create actionable

        opportunities based on attractiveness and feasibility \\n- Profiling of major

        involves defining target markets, data discovery/analysis using FedSavvy's
        proprietary databases and external sources, interim reviews, and final delivery
        structured to address core research needs.\\n\\nMergers & Acquisitions Targeting:
        FedSavvy provides services to prospect and assess potential acquisition targets
        aligned with the client's growth plans. Deliverables include identifying targets
        that fit business needs, quantifying the target's contract portfolio/revenue,
        assessing benefits/risks, and evaluating intellectual property.\\n\\nFedAgency
        Insight Reports: These are standardized products providing detailed analysis
        on the buying behavior, spending trends, leadership, and opportunities for
        specific federal agencies like DHS, U.S. Army, Department of State, etc. The
        reports are offered annually for $2,195 each.\\n\\nRapid CI: This is a tailored
        competitive intelligence sprint offered by FedSavvy at $3,995, likely providing
        compressed analysis and recommendations on a focused area.\\n\\nBattle Cards:
        One-page competitor profiles developed by FedSavvy to serve as easy reference

        services.\\n\\nBlack Hat Review Sessions: Interactive working sessions facilitated
        by FedSavvy experts to analyze competitors, positioning, and bid strategies
        for particular opportunities.\\n\\nIn summary, FedSavvy Strategies provides
        a comprehensive suite of market and competitive intelligence offerings ranging
        from high-level assessments to granular pursuits analysis centered around

        Strategies operates in the market intelligence and competitive analysis services
        market, with a specific focus on the federal government contracting industry.
        Their core offerings include strategic market research, competitive intelligence,
        capture and proposal support, opportunity assessments, agency trend analysis,
        and related advisory services.\\n\\nFedSavvy's total addressable market (TAM)
        is essentially the entire federal contracting marketplace, which was valued
        at around $668 billion in fiscal year 2022 based on government spending data
        across civilian agencies and the Department of Defense.\\n\\nTheir serviceable
        available market (SAM) consists of companies actively pursuing new federal
        contracts that require in-depth market intelligence, competitive analysis,
        and strategic advisory support to increase their chances of winning bids.
        This includes large established federal contractors as well as mid-tier and
        smaller firms looking to break into or expand within the federal market across
        sectors like technology, consulting, defense, healthcare and others. While
        the exact SAM size is unclear, rival firms suggest it is a multibillion-dollar
        market.\\n\\nFedSavvy's serviceable obtainable market (SOM) refers to the
        portion of that SAM that they can realistically capture and serve based on
        their specialized capabilities, pricing models, brand reputation and the competitive
        landscape. As a boutique consultancy deeply focused on major federal pursuits,
        their SOM allows them to gain a relatively small but focused share of the
        wider federal market intelligence services arena. Their revenues under $5
        million per year indicate their SOM is a niche subset deeply engaged in high-stakes
        federal contracting opportunities that benefit from FedSavvy's tailored expertise
        and data-driven insights.\\n\\nIn essence, while FedSavvy's total addressable
        market is massive given the scale of federal procurement spending, their key
        markets are the subsegments of companies heavily invested in strategic positioning,
        opportunity scouting, and competitive analysis to win lucrative federal contracts
        at both prime and subcontractor levels across civilian and defense agencies.
        FedSavvy aims to empower their clients' success in this arena through specialized
        management consulting offerings centered around actionable market and competitive
        intelligence.\",\"Based on the information from FedSavvy Strategies' website,
        here is a SWOT analysis covering their key strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,
        and threats:\\n\\nStrengths:\\n- Specialized expertise and over 10 years of
        experience in the federal contracting market, helping clients win billions
        of dollars in contracts\\n- Proprietary databases and unique analytical methods
        for actionable market/competitive intelligence \\n- Intense focus on providing
        tailored, data-driven insights versus generic market research\\n- Carefully
        selected team with formal training in intelligence analysis techniques used
        by the intelligence community\\n- Founder's philosophy of enabling client
        success through realistic strategies and thoughtful analysis\\n\\nWeaknesses:
        \\n- Small boutique consulting firm with limited public information on size,
        resources and brand awareness compared to larger competitors\\n- Appears to
        have no parent company or investment funding for rapid expansion\\n- Pricing
        models and specific expertise not fully transparent on website\\n- No proprietary
        software tools or AI/machine learning capabilities mentioned unlike some rivals\\n\\nOpportunities:\\n-
        Potential to expand service offerings leveraging their federal expertise into
        adjacencies like state/local government contracts\\n- Rising demand for specialized
        competitive intelligence as the federal market gets more competitive\\n- Ability
        to invest in building out data analytics capabilities and intellectual property
        around their proprietary databases\\n- Market for M&A advisory related to
        acquisitions by federal contractors\\n\\nThreats:\\n- Emerging technology-driven
        competitors like Govini utilizing AI/ML and big data analytics for procurement
        intelligence\\n- Larger, diversified management consultancies with more resources
        to invest in federal market intelligence capabilities\\n- Disruption from
        alternative data providers and open data sources reducing barriers to entry\\n-
        Economic pressures or spending cuts impacting demand for consulting services
        in the federal contracting ecosystem\\n\\nIn summary, FedSavvy's key strengths
        are its specialized expertise, proprietary data sources, and client-focused
        philosophy. However, its relatively small size, lack of technology differentiation,
        and the rise of data-driven competitors pose potential weaknesses and threats
        going forward. Opportunities exist in expanding into adjacencies and developing
        new data analytics capabilities.\"]}"
