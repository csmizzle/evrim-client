        support, opportunity assessments, agency trend analysis, and related advisory
        services.\\n\\nFedSavvy's total addressable market (TAM) is essentially the
        entire federal contracting marketplace, which was valued at around $668 billion
        in fiscal year 2022 based on government spending data across civilian agencies
        and the Department of Defense.\\n\\nTheir serviceable available market (SAM)
        consists of companies actively pursuing new federal contracts that require
        in-depth market intelligence, competitive analysis, and strategic advisory
        support to increase their chances of winning bids. This includes large established
        federal contractors as well as mid-tier and smaller firms looking to break
        into or expand within the federal market across sectors like technology, consulting,
        defense, healthcare and others. While the exact SAM size is unclear, rival
        firms suggest it is a multibillion-dollar market.\\n\\nFedSavvy's serviceable
        obtainable market (SOM) refers to the portion of that SAM that they can realistically
        capture and serve based on their specialized capabilities, pricing models,
        brand reputation and the competitive landscape. As a boutique consultancy
        deeply focused on major federal pursuits, their SOM allows them to gain a
        relatively small but focused share of the wider federal market intelligence
        services arena. Their revenues under $5 million per year indicate their SOM

        essence, while FedSavvy's total addressable market is massive given the scale

        companies heavily invested in strategic positioning, opportunity scouting,
        and competitive analysis to win lucrative federal contracts at both prime
        and subcontractor levels across civilian and defense agencies. FedSavvy aims
